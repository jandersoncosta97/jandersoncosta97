### My general setup:

Hey, my name is Janderson, I am from Brazil, and I live in Recife-PE. 
Generally, I have no significant restrictions to working in other states or countries.

### Interests and goals

I have a broad range of interests since I am passionate about improving my hard skills.
Myy attention concerns learning software development to apply in science and human ecosystems.
The scientific aspect is well-touched worldwide. I have the goal of merging high-performance technologies with the well-being of humanity.
Tecnological tools came to facilitate livings. However, many people may not have suitable senses to deal with the recent and increasing changes along this timestamp.
I would say that many will not adapt themselves, especially for scenes of years or decades of work.

### Typical situations I would like to contribute: 
Technology applied to microplastic in natural resources (detection, quantification, management, using software, robotic-devices, databases, Machine Learning, computer vision, and so on).
Technology applied to microplastic in human bodies (side effects, future problems, prevention, people awareness, easier fat tissue accumulation, blood, and associaded side effects).

AI to juridical investigation: (pulse, body, personality threats, voice, facial expressions) to auxiliary juridical evaluation.
AI and technology are applied to other kinds of juridical investigations, such as blood, and people tracking.

ML to predict components in water.
ML to predict chemical components in food products.

AI to chips in animals, and some restricted classes of people.

Many other things, such as Yoga techniques diffusion, practice.
Development of empathy, real-world changing, and adaptation.

Computer vision applied to smartphone testing is something that is provoking a wonderful engagement.
I am perplexed by the amount of things that can be done with it.



### Learning

Robotics (Denso robot).
Computer vision (OpenCV).
Python Back End (transitions, ADB, OOP in general)
Environment package managers (Typically conda)
Ubuntu Bash

### Background

Robotics (Nyrio Ned API, Kinova API).
ROS 1.
Artificial Intelligence (YOLO v.8, PyTorch, Tensorflow.)
PDI
Modules 1 to 4 in IT support from Coursera.
Scientific computer simulations using RK4 implemented in Fortran, and Python, during a Master's degree in Materials Science. Project: Luminescent materials
Bachelor's in Industrial chemistry (minor relevant tech tools to mention)
Summer courses, and research in Physics.


### Honors

(I will add them later)


### Soft skills

(I will add them later)


### Fun facts

Usually, I am much more free to express myself according to the context.
I notice people's intentions, and unconscious patterns at ease.

I am passionate about hacking, but I did not dedicate myself to it, except a long time ago.

(I will look deeply into this field)
